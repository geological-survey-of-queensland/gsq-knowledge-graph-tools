# GSQ Knowledge Graph Tools

Welcome to the GSQ Knowledge Graph Tools repository. This repository is a curated collection of code and tools designed for the creation, interaction, and visualization of knowledge graphs.

## Current Subdirectories

- **Labelled Property Graphs (LPG)**: This subdirectory is home to our Labelled Property Graph tooling, which includes converters for transforming data from multiple sources into an LPG format, as well as a visualisation tool, `2D_lpg_viewer.html`, that allows for easy exploration of graphs directly from your web browser. Access the Labelled Property Graphs tools [here](./lpg).

_Further subdirectories will be added to this list as the repository grows._
